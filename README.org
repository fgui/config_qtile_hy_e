#+title: My simplish Hy Qtile conf

* Requirement

Edit your qtile (=which qtile=) to add =import hy=.
Tried to add a __init__.py to import hy in the config folder. There
has to be a better way.

* Notes

Qtile keeps copying a =config.py= in the configuration folder. There has
to be a simple way to stop this. I don't know how. Luckly when I enter
Qtile the =config.hy= is honored instead of =config.py=.
